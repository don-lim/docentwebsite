            	<P>What does an Indoor Positioning System do? People use positioning systems such as GPS on an hourly basis without realizing. However, GPS doesn’t work inside a building and do not provide enough accuracy to be useful in indoors venues where things are very close to each other. A lack of a standard and inexpensive Indoor Positioning System prevents businesses from providing Indoor Location Based Services that can bring greater satisfaction of customers who are now turning to online shopping.<br><br>
Here’s an analogy:  A Hollywood movie the Thomas Crown Affair depicts the heist of a Monet.  Detectives are foiled by several men as they scatter throughout the museum in identical bowler hats.  What if the museum had an indoor positioning system?  Well, they would’ve known which man in the bowler hat was Thomas Crown.   Even better, the detectives and the museum’s insurance company would’ve known that the Monet was returned a day later, on the same museum wall, hidden under another painting. <br><br>
				1. In an indoor setting, accuracy in differentiating one person or asset from another, that is the proximity from one object to the next, is the key. An indoor positioning system must provide a much greater accuracy compared to GPS systems which are used over long distances or areas. Staying with our Thomas Crown analogy, you would’ve known, for example, the location of the Monet until it left the premises.  You would’ve known how long Crown lingered in any given location and when he returned to that location.  You would also have data, down to ten second date and time intervals, that the Monet went missing and when it returned to the premises. <br><br>
2. In the staircase scene, Crown and several men in bowler hats travel up and down staircases from floor to floor, in order to confuse detectives. With our Indoor Positioning System, you would’ve known the exact floor Thomas Crown was on that fateful day. Each visitor is unique and counted once, eliminating duplication errors.  Furthermore, the proprietary Indoor Positioning System from Docent, depicts a multi-level view (floor view) a person is on as opposed to more conventional methods depicting a flat one-dimensional view of an asset or person.  An indoor positioning system provides information whether it’s one building or multiple buildings with several floors.
