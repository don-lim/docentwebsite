				<h1>IPS - Indoor Positioning System</h1>
				<p>People use positioning systems like GPS on an hourly basis without realizing it. However, GPS doesn’t work indoors and does not provide enough accuracy to be useful in indoor venues where things are very close to each other. Indoor Location Based Services can bring greater satisfaction of customers who are now turning to online shopping.<br><br>
				Docent provides several different types of proprietary Indoor Positioning Systems which were granted patents internationally. We are one of the pioneers of IPS industry. Our first patent was granted in 2013, before iBeacon was announced in 2014.

				<h1>Indoor Map Platform</h1>
				<p>Docent’s Indoor Map Platform is an interactive web-based local map that shows your objects on each floor with different icons. It’s more versatile than standard open source maps and you can change objects on your map easily without asking a technician. <br><br>
				It can be embedded in your existing website, mobile apps, and kiosks by calling an API as well as integrated with our Chromap™ and Securitrack™ that use our Indoor Positioning System. Contact us for a free demo.
