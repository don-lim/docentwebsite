                <P> <br>With Docent, you can count on apps that provide ease-of-use with the most engaging design and user-experience in mind. When we can't find features we believe will deliver an optimized experience, we build our own. Our team developed proprietary technology to power such features as our search engines, auto-suggest, drag-to-select reservation engine, visual calendar, and vector-based maps. And the best part about it is that because we've built this technology in-house, you get the most advanced features in the market, at a fraction of the price other shops will charge when they have to outsource.
					<br><br>
					But, our apps and user interfaces are more than just functional, they are also beautifully designed. 
					<br><br>	
					With everything from world-class performing arts centers and museums to luxury shopping malls and theme parks as our customers, our user interfaces deliver a visually pleasing yet highly functional experience that opens your venue's virtual doors to the world.
