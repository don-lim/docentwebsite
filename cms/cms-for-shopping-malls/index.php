            	<P>Docent CMS for Shopping Malls application manages malls with hundreds of stores. Each store’s profile organizes them into one or more categories:  Food &amp; Beverage, Electronics, Fashion, Service, or by a broader, more generic category. Each store’s profile displays their description, location by floor, hours of operation, contact information, store website URL, and whether it includes dining facilities. If the store has a dining facility it can be tagged by the type of cuisine offered.<br><br>
				Shops can also be categorized by Target demographic, Women, Kids, Family, or Entertainment under the Occasion field.  Notices can be pushed to everyone on the floor or to a targeted population.  Notices might be about extended holiday hours, events, or other notices that a customer might not normally be aware of.<br><br>
				Promotions can be combined with Accufencing™ so that a customer can receive specific notifications or promotions when entering a pre-defined perimeter. These notifications can also be pushed to a whole building or a particular floor without Accufencing™. Using Docent’s Content Management System (CMS), managing those deals just got easier.
