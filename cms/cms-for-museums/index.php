            	<P>Docent’s CMS for Museums gives you the ability to manage several museum locations and different languages. Once in a particular location, category and floor attributes can be easily modified. Categories of museum assets can be created, such as Archeology, Ceramics, Prehistoric, etc. Collections for special exhibits can be created in order to assign specific objects to that collection.<br><br>
				Each object’s profile can display images and their assigned categories.  Objects can also be searched across different categories.  Descriptions in different languages can be edited with such information as artwork dimensions, artist’s name, period the piece represents, and location of origin. Audio files may also be uploaded for each object in different languages.<br><br>
				CMS for Museums also feature a simple Membership Management for small museums or  galleries. Email addresses of members can be collected for those who have downloaded your app, signed in to your website or opted in for SMS text messages.
